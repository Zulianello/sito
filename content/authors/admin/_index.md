I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science (tenure-track) in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the University of Trieste.

I am currently co-writing a monograph for Oxford University Press (with Daniele Albertazzi and others) on the survival of the mass party among the populist radical right.

My work has focused on populism, radicalism, extremism, political competition, comparative politics and mixed-method research.

My first monograph, entitled “[Anti-system parties: from parliamentary breakthrough to government](https://www.routledge.com/Anti-System-Parties-From-Parliamentary-Breakthrough-to-Government/Zulianello/p/book/9780367730970)” was published by Routledge (Extremism and Democracy Series) in 2019, and my articles have appeared in international journals such as Electoral Studies, Government and Opposition, The International Journal of Press/Politics, Politics and Governance, Quality and Quantity – International Journal of Methodology, European Politics and Society, and Contemporary Italian Politics.

I also edited and foreworded the Italian edition of the book “*[Populism: a very short introduction](https://academic.oup.com/book/866)”* (2017), written by C. Mudde and C. Rovira Kaltwasser.

I am also the coordinator of the Summer School “[Populism: Causes, ](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/course/calendar/populismo-cause-impatto-e-conseguenze-distance-learning-31238)[Impact](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/course/calendar/populismo-cause-impatto-e-conseguenze-distance-learning-31238)[ and Consequences](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/course/calendar/populismo-cause-impatto-e-conseguenze-distance-learning-31238)” and Winter School "[Challenges to Democratic Governance in the Western World](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/course/calendar/le-sfide-alla-governance-democratica-nel-mondo-occidentale-modalita-web-live-35870)" at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) in Milan, and co-convenor of the PSA Italian Politics Specialist Group.
