I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science (tenure-track) in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the University of Trieste.

I am also the coordinator of the Summer School “[Populism: Causes, ](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/course/calendar/populismo-cause-impatto-e-conseguenze-distance-learning-31238)[Impact](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/course/calendar/populismo-cause-impatto-e-conseguenze-distance-learning-31238)[ and Consequences](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/course/calendar/populismo-cause-impatto-e-conseguenze-distance-learning-31238)” and Winter School "[Challenges to Democratic Governance in the Western World](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/course/calendar/le-sfide-alla-governance-democratica-nel-mondo-occidentale-modalita-web-live-35870)" at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) in Milan, and co-convenor of the PSA Italian Politics Specialist Group.

My work has focused on populism, radicalism, extremism, political competition, comparative politics and mixed-method research.

My first monograph, entitled “[Anti-system parties: from parliamentary breakthrough to government](https://www.routledge.com/Anti-System-Parties-From-Parliamentary-Breakthrough-to-Government/Zulianello/p/book/9780367730970)” was published by Routledge (Extremism and Democracy Series) in 2019, and my articles have appeared in international journals such as Electoral Studies, Government and Opposition, The International Journal of Press/Politics, Politics and Governance, Quality and Quantity – International Journal of Methodology, European Politics and Society, and Contemporary Italian Politics.

I also edited and foreworded the Italian edition of the book “*[Populism: a very short introduction](https://academic.oup.com/book/866)”* (2017), written by C. Mudde and C. Rovira Kaltwasser.
